*Group 3 split up, but this portion of the project fairly belongs to all 3 members since we all worked on it evenly.

## Learning method:

To be determined after more research and experimentation.

## Proposal:

The problem that we at Clarity Inc. are trying to solve as a group is about Natural Languages. The goal is to detect when two sentences are related or not across 15 different languages utilizing 3 labels: entailment, neutral, or contradiction. This problem is interesting because this sort of language processing can help immensely when it comes to grammar checking, context identification, and fact checking/fake news detection. It’s also fascinating how a computer can take a context-based activity like language and identify the hidden semantics.

We will be analyzing existing papers that analyze sentence relations as a central focus for their algorithm. We will look for algorithms applied in the past on similar problems to what we are trying to achieve and reason at what is necessary for us to include. The Kaggle competition provides training and evaluation data sets in 15 languages, so we will utilize the given resources. Since the algorithm will be one involving NLP (Natural Language Processing), we will research one relevant to the question at hand. Mainly, we want to adapt an algorithm to be an effective sentence relation classifier across the 15 different languages.

We are going to be evaluating our results quantitatively, by seeing how many sentences we are able to classify correctly and providing accuracy scores for our predictions with the use of the test data set. We will also explore plotting the results across the different languages using a bar chart.

The languages included in the competition's data sets are:
```
Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Thai, Turkish, Urdu and Vietnamese.
